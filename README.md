# JavaScript In The Browser - Forms

This is a school project in validating forms native and custom.
I desided to use this assignment to start creating a form we are
going to use in our Module 3 group project. There were somethings
I couldn't implement the way the group project will be becouse of
the restricons of this assignment. Do to lack of time I did not
style the forms but everything works.

You can press on "Velja líðan" and get a dropdown you can choose from.
If you press on "Bæta líðan" a modal opens up with a input field wich
you can write something in and press the "Bæta við" button and it adds
what's in the input field to the dropdown list and the modal closes. You
can also press on the x on the modal or outside it to close it. You can
press on the calendar icon in the date field to open up a calendar to choose
a date from. Then there is the multi line text area wich you can write in.
Every field displays an custom error messegaes if not filled out or chosen.
If everything is valid while pressin the "Staðfesta" button it will alert
succsess and the form will refresh.

You can find comments in the code to explain the it.
